QuickDex
========

A lightweight desktop Pokedex application in .NET

About
=====
The goal of this project is to provide an application that allows a quick lookup of Pokemon data from various sources
with a very few number of keypresses. Enter the number or name of a pokemon and instantly view locally stored data
or get linked to a third party site of your choosing, such as Serebii or Bulbapedia. This application consumes the
public PokeAPI, found here: http://pokeapi.co/

State of Implementation
=======================
This project is currently still in development. The major bits of design have been done, and some wrappers have been
written for the PokeAPI. The beginnings of the caching system have been implemented to cut down the number of API
calls needed. Most of the work that needs to be done concerns extending current functionality and building the UI
portion of the application.
